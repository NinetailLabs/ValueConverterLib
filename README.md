# ValueConverterLib
[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/yfdeedydol3yamul?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/DeadlyEmbrace/valueconverterlib)

A library that contains a collection of Value converters (implementing the IValueConverter) interface that is ready to use out of the box.
The idea is to provide a turnkey solution that contains frequently used converters so you don't have to roll them each time you need them
